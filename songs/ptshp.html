    The other day I got a call
    The ringtone was some creepy guy singin'
    But just as I rushed over to my phone
    It decided to quit ringin'

    My phone said I had a missed call
    From my friend, his name was Mater
    So I called him right back
    But it went to voicemail, and said to call later

    WHY WON'T YOU ANSWER THE STUPID PHONE??
    I literally called you five seconds later
    It makes me wanna feed you to
    A really hungry alligator

    Another time that exact same friend
    Texted me fifty times, asked if I was there
    I obviously wasn't around
    But the obviously didn't care
    My last story's about another friend
    His name was Larry
    We were having a friendly conversation about
    Things that are scary

    I asked him a question about ghosts
    Then he ghosted me
    It made me want to
    Tie him to a really tall tree

    These people shouldn't have phones
    It's making me go insane
    They're just causing everyone
    A whole lot of pain
