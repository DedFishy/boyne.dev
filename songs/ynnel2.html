Everyone hated
Jack for his crime
They avoided him like
He was a mime

Then one evening
Something came in the mail
The very sight of it
Made Jack's prosecutor go pale

Inside was a cake
And Ynnel left a note
It explained how he escaped
And used Jack as a scapegoat

Ynnel was getting threats at camp
That's why he had to leave
He faked his own death
And made everybody grieve

But he succeeded
He was back at his tree
Ynnel was
As safe as could be

The campers lit
The candles on the cake
The candles exploded
And smoke covered the lake
