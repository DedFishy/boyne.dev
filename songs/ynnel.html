    There once was a coconut
Big as could be
Hanging on a really tall
Coconut tree

He was shipped to the US
Then to Walmart
And a lonely boy named Jack
Put the coconut in his cart

The reason he took it is 'cause
He knew another nut named Lenny
So he bought this one
For two bucks and 48 pennies

He named the coconut Ynnel
And he loved Ynnel so
He'd take Ynnel
Everywhere he'd go

Then one day Jack brought him
To a camp, UPBC
Ynnel loved it more than
His coconut tree

Then for no reason
Jack got a rock that was round
And he tore and cut Ynnel
And his juice poured on the ground

They brought him to court
And there he was tried
There they discussed
How Ynnel died

"Is the defendant guilty?"
The judge asked the jury
As they decided
Jack began to worry

Jack decided to run
He bolted out the door
This convinced the judge
All the more

Everyone agreed
His crime was filthy
The verdict was in
He was guilty

Everybody mourned
Weeks afterward
It was the saddest story
Ever heard
